This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in COBOL programs involving numeric field overflow.  The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version. The bug occurs when attempting to increment or perform arithmetic operations that exceed the capacity of a defined numeric field.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and program crashes.  The solution involves using a larger numeric field or implementing appropriate overflow checks.
